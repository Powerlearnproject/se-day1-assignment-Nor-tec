#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Answer; Software engineering is the systematuc application of engineeri g principles, methods abd tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. In the technology industry, software engineering is important in ensuring;
1)Reliability- it ensures softwares perform as expected.
2)Effeciency- helps to optimize workflow while maibtaining high quality.
3)scalability- Software engeneering helps in thr creation of flexible softwares.
4)Security- ensuring that malicious viruses and any other harm is kept away from the applications made thus effeciency


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of software engeneering as a discipline in 1960s as a result of failure of softwares at the time due to poor development mechanisms which lead to the advent of structured programming in 1970s as well as the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This invoves gathering all necessary resources for development.
Design:Involves creation of database designs as well as system achitecture as well as technical specifications
Implementation:Involves using the  chosen programming language to write code for the software.
Testing: The software is put to test to identify and fix bugs 
Deployment: the users are given access to the software 
Maintenance: important for system updates to ensure that they are not outdated as well as to fix any bugs that may come about.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequencial with distinct phases while the agile methodology is hierachial and incremental. The waterfall methodology will most likely be suitable for creation of a software for a medical device while agile would be suitable for gaming apps. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer- designs, creates and maintains software systems. 
Quality assurance engineer- ensures software quality and is also in charge of software testing.
Project manager- responsible for project timing and ensuring overall smootg running of the development process.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide an enabling platform for writting, implementing and debbuging code. Example visual studio  
VCS helps track changes and enables collaboration of developer to increase effeciency of code and overall software systems. ecample Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Bugs in code- Debugging features help identify and gives suggestions for corrections.
Technical debt- Reguraly restructure code to enhance effeciency. 
Deadlines- While Coding may sound all fun, developers are constantly under pressure to create high quality softwares at fixed schedules to fix this collaboration is advised
Technology dynamic nature- developers should Keep learning 



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing the different functions of a software in isolation. It is useful in detecting bugs in the early development stages. 
Integration testing involves testing the interaction of different modules and is useful to detect any defects between the modules.
System testing involves testing the whole software system. Important in determining the overal performance of the software as well as identification of bugs that affect the whole system.
Acceptance testing involves the end- users to determine how applicable the system is to the real world situation. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promt Engineering is the art of crafting optimized prompts to effectively interact with AI models.
The importance of Prompt engineeeing in interacting with AI models is that it enhances AI performance by reducing ambiguity, facilitates better user experience as reliable responses are availed when prompts are precise and through this the AI usability is made optimal.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:How are dogs like?
Improved Prompt: How do dogs behave when hungry?
The first prompt is vague as it is an open question that atracts a general response of how dogs are like whereas the improves prompt is precisely asking about the 'behaviour' of dogs speciffically 'when hungry'.
